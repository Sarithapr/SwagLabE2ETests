## Project Overview

This project automates end-to-end testing scenarios for an ecommerce platform using Cypress. It verifies key user journeys such as authentication, cart management, and checkout functionality, ensuring the application works as intended.

## Folder Structure

- `cypress/` - Contains all test cases, fixtures, and support files
- `cypress/integration/` - Main test scripts
- `cypress/fixtures/` - Test data (e.g., user credentials)
- `cypress/support/` - Custom commands and reusable utilities
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Recommended: Latest version of Chrome, Firefox, or Edge for running tests in headed mode

## Getting Started

First and foremost, install your dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Tests

You can run the tests using the following commands:

To launch the Cypress Test Runner (for interactive mode):

```bash
npx cypress open
```

To run all tests in headless mode (useful for CI/CD pipelines):

```bash
npx cypress run
```

## Reporting

- By default, Cypress provides basic test run output in the terminal.
- For additional reporting (e.g., HTML, JUnit), you can integrate plugins like [mochawesome](https://github.com/adamgruber/mochawesome).
- To generate an HTML report after running tests, install Mochawesome:

  ```bash
  npm install mochawesome --save-dev
  ```

  Then, run Cypress with the reporter:

  ```bash
  npx cypress run --reporter mochawesome
  ```

  The HTML report will be available in the `mochawesome-report` directory.
